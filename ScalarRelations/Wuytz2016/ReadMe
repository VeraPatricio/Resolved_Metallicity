Abstract:
    We present measurements of the [NII]/H{alpha} ratio as a probe of
    gas-phase oxygen abundance for a sample of 419 star-forming galaxies
    at z=0.6-2.7 from the KMOS^3D^ near-IR multi-integral field unit (IFU)
    survey. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is determined consistently
    with the same sample selection, metallicity tracer, and methodology
    over the wide redshift range probed by the survey. We find good
    agreement with long-slit surveys in the literature, except for the
    low-mass slope of the relation at z~2.3, where this sample is less
    biased than previous samples based on optical spectroscopic redshifts.
    In this regime we measure a steeper slope than some literature
    results. Excluding the contribution from active galactic nuclei from
    the MZR reduces sensitivity at the high-mass end, but produces
    otherwise consistent results. There is no significant dependence of
    the [NII]/H{alpha} ratio on star formation rate at fixed redshift and
    stellar mass. The IFU data allow spatially resolved measurements of
    [NII]/H{alpha}, from which we can infer abundance gradients for 180
    galaxies, thus tripling the current sample in the literature. The
    observed gradients are on average flat, with only 15 gradients
    statistically offset from zero at >3{sigma}. We have modeled the
    effect of beam smearing, assuming a smooth intrinsic radial gradient
    and known seeing, inclination, and effective radius for each galaxy.
    Our seeing-limited observations can recover up to 70% of the intrinsic
    gradient for the largest, face-on disks, but only 30% for the smaller,
    more inclined galaxies. We do not find significant trends between
    observed or corrected gradients and any stellar population, dynamical,
    or structural galaxy parameters, mostly in agreement with existing
    studies with much smaller sample sizes. In cosmological simulations,
    strong feedback is generally required to produce flat gradients at
    high redshift.

Description:
    The galaxies analyzed here are taken from the first 2yr of the
    KMOS^3D^ survey, which covers observations up to 2015 April. The
    survey is described in detail by Wisnioski+ (2015ApJ...799..209W).
    KMOS^3D^ is a 5yr GTO survey with the multi-object near-IR integral
    field spectrograph KMOS at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).
